HollyParker: Hi, I'm Holly and I'm 14. I have recently been invited to 2 SDSs to help out, which is something that means a lot to me. I've been part of Scratch since I was 10, and I love being a part of the community. I love DC, Marvel, Star Wars, Lego, Harry Potter, Miraculous, Pokemon, Moshi Monsters, Ninjago, Nintendo and pushes. Thanks for reading!

swim1016: Hi! I'm Swim1016, and I'm an SDS helper, a past FPC, and love to help around scratch in anyway I can! I love to give feedback! I love scratch, dance, swimming, and the color purple!

R4356th: Hi! I am R4356th, an SDS Translator, a PSTBF Translator, a Scratch Translator, Test and English Scratch Wiki Editor and I also have helped to code Scratch. I write stories, code websites and do other things. Thank you for reading this!

vinu45654: Hi, I'm vinu45654, you can call me vinu. I'm an SDS and PPTBF translator (honestly the last thing is not very impressive, it was just a small translation but it sounds proffesional). I've been in Scratch for five years now, but only 2 making (sort of) quality projects. I like Minecraft a lot and I hope to be able to help as much as I can.
